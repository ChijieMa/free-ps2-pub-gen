*** Free PS2 Pub Gen ***

 Automated Tool for flatz PS4- PS2 Emu PKG Technic. Either place the Tool into the same
 folder then make_fself.py, orbis-pub-cmd-ps2.exe and the authinfo_emu.txt within the template folder.
 Or drop the needed files into the GUI and close and reopen her. You could then even move the App.
 Drop the ISO onto the GUI and the Output Folder too or use the buttons to define one.
 When you double click the iso and output textBox it will change between ISO or Output Path.
 
 Place a decrypted eboot.elf and ps2-emu-compiler.elf into app0\ and the same with libc.prx and libSceFios2.prx into app0\sce_module.
 As soon i can thoes 4 decrypted elfs i will include them into the template folder Fake PKG Tools. 
 
 If i have forgoten something in the readme, i'll add it later.
 For the tool just tell me on twitter what does not work for you and i'll fix as soon as possible.
 
 Special THX to @zordon605, @ps3120 and @Celest123
 
 Removed the PS4 TitleID and replaced it with the PS2 TitleID to avoid conflicts with real TitleIDs.
 THX to @littlebalup for letting me know.
