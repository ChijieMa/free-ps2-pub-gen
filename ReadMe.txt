*** Free PS2 Pub Gen ***

 Automated Tool for flatz PS4- PS2 Emu PKG Technic. Either place the Tool into the same
 folder then make_fself.py, orbis-pub-cmd-ps2.exe and the aithinfo_emu.txt within the template folder.
 Or drop the needed files into the GUI and close and reopen her. You could then even move the App.
 Drop the ISO onto the GUI and the Output Folder too or use the buttons to define one.
 When you double click the iso and output textBox it will change between ISO or Output Path.
 
 For the template if you use your own one till i did come too share a pkg with a template:
 Place your Extracted PS4 PS2 Emu PKG with decrypted files into the folder '\template\template_pkg\'
 Put template.gp4 into '\template\' the same goes for authinfo_emu.txt.
 Files which we need to resign place into '\template\workfiles\' eg:
 eboot.bin, ps2-emu-compiler.self, Image0/sce_module/libSceFios2.prx, Image0/sce_module/libc.prx and Image0\config-emu-ps4.txt.
 
 Make sure to edit your gp4 file and Comment Out npbind.dat/nptitle.dat and trophy00.trp XML Style (<!-- -->). If you need them later
 the app will edit the project file and add them back.
 
 If i have forgoten something in the readme, i'll add it later.
 For the tool just tell me on twitter what does not work for you and i'll fix as soon as possible.
 
 Special THX to @zordon605 and @ps3120
